# Introduction

I have been learning data science as a fellow of the Arewa Data Science Academy since January, 2023 and I have picked many skills. This is an attempt to practice quarto using the R programming language, in the RStudio IDE. I will work on the palmerpenguins dataset. Work in progress!

## Data {.smaller}

For this analysis, we 'll use the penguins dataset from the palmerpenguins package. [@gorman2014]

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(gt)
```

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

## Meet Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Meet the penguins

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/main/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio/lter_penguins.png){style="float:right;" fig-alt="Illustration of three species of Palmer Archipelago penguins: Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adelie. Artwork by @allison_horst." width="401"}

The `penguins` data from the [**palmerpenguins**](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins "palmerpenguins R package") package contains size measurements for `r nrow(penguins)` penguins from three species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

The plot below shows the relationship between flipper and bill lengths of these penguins.

```{r}
#| label: plot-penguins
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(
    title = "Flipper and bill length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)",
    color = "Penguin species", shape = "Penguin species"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Species

@fig-bill-dim-species is a scatter plot of species of penguins

```{r}
#| label: fig-bill-dim-species
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-asp: 0.618
#| fig-alt: |
#|   A scatterplot of penguin's bill depth and length, colored by species of penguins. There is a relatively strong linear association. 
#| fig-cap: |
#|  A scatterplot of penguin's bill depth and length, colored by species of penguins.
#|  output-location: slide

ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x=bill_length_mm, y= bill_depth_mm,color=species,shape=species)) + geom_point() + theme_minimal() + scale_color_colorblind()  + labs( x = "Bill length (mm)", y = "Bill depth (mm)")

```

## Penguins

@tbl-penguins-top10 shows the first ten penguins from the dataset.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-penguins-top10
#| tbl-cap: First 10 penguins.

penguins %>%
  slice_head(n=10) %>%
  select(species,island,bill_length_mm,bill_depth_mm) %>%
  gt()

```
